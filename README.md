This application gives youthe essence of Spotify. The user can add songs to their library, organizing them by genre. They can edit the songs they added, such as changing the genre and 
transferring that song to another genre. Users may also delete songs as they please. 

## Motivation
Music is a huge passion of mine. Since childhood I see myself working in the music industry, regardless of field. One of my hobbies is crafting different kinds playlists, depending on genre and/or emotion. In the future I hope to be able to upgrade this application to something even bigger and more useful.
